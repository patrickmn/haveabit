<h1>About</h1>
<div id="left">
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Have a Bit compiles the most profound, inspiring, insightful, controversial, and sometimes humorous quotations, images and video footage of the world's most esteemed scientists, philosophers, activists, and other freethinkers. Our mission is to share with you the thoughts of some of the greatest men and women who have walked this rock; people who dared contemplate the universe's deepest questions, with little regard for the status quo or any possible retaliation from their peers or people in authority.</p>

<p>Although there a lot of quotations here, Have a Bit is not a quotes site. A "Bit" of a person may be anything from a quote to images or video. The site also does not gather as many quotes as possible, but rather those that we think are the most awe-inspiring, witty or true.</p>

<p>So, stay a while. Have a <a href="/random" title="Have a Bit of Random" rel="nofollow">Random Bit</a>.</p>
